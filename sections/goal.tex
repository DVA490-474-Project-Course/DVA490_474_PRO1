\section{Goal}
\label{section:goal}

The goal of the project is to deliver the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item One \ac{ssl}-RoboCup division B robot which complies with all \ac{ssl}-RoboCup regulations and Swedish laws and standards\footnote{European laws and standards will be deferred to if the Swedish and \ac{ssl}-RoboCup rules, laws and standards are ambiguous or do not address a specific topic.}. The robot is to be capable of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Taking actions which are oriented towards goal scoring
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Omnidirectional movement towards target pose
            \item Kick ball
            \item Pass ball
        \end{itemize}
        \item Taking actions which impede the enemy teams ability to score goals
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Block a straight kicked ball from opponents
        \end{itemize}
        \item Not crash into other robots or the arena
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This point is nullified when trying to steal the ball, as long as no permanent damage is inflicted on any robot
        \end{itemize}
        \item Act accordingly to the referee commands and signals
        \item Swap field sides on demand
        \item (See\:\cite{noauthor_rules_2024} for the demands which the robots must fulfil to comply with the \ac{ssl}-RoboCup rules, they will not be listed here but are included as goals)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Simulation interface, allowing for interaction with the simulation software grSim.
    \item Hardware interface, allowing low level control over the robots.
    \item \ac{ssl} interface, allowing for interaction with the \ac{ssl} tools ssl-vision and ssl-game-controller, and integration of AutoReferee.
    \item Robot control using \ac{ros2} Humble and/or micro-\acs{ros}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Path planning
        \item Setting up robot for a shot
    \end{itemize}
    \item Centralised strategy and tactics planner for the robot team using \ac{ai}, commanding what action each robot should take.
    \item Peer to peer communication protocol using Protobuf and \ac{ros2} Humble, which can select between two carrier frequencies. 
    \item The entire system passing \ac{hil} testing.
\end{enumerate}
