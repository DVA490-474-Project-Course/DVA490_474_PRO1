\subsection{Roles, responsibilities and authorities}
\label{section:staffing_roles_responsibilities_and_authorities}

%The project teams, and their tasks, have been organised to try to ensure good collaboration, effective use of the members skills and qualifications, as well as their wishes. 
Three authoritative roles with their own responsibilities were assigned (by the sponsor):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Team Leader: Responsible for guiding and coordinating the group to achieve a common goal. A team leader is also responsible for making plans, assigning tasks, ensuring team collaboration, solving conflict, motivating the group and making key decision. One of the main responsibilities of a team leader is to communicate between the team and stakeholders, ensuring that the development process follows the broader project vision.  
    \item Software lead: Organises the software team to ensure work continues smoothly and that the software requirements are met. This includes scheduling, overseeing the software teams progress, planning the software layout and thorough inspection of standards and requirements. 
    \item Hardware lead: Manages the hardware team by overseeing the tasks, provide planning and making sure all requirements are met.
\end{itemize}
