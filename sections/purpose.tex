\section{Purpose}
\label{section:purpose}

The purpose of this project is to have a positive impact on both \ac{mdu} and its students. The project would do so in the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It would include, and therefore cultivate, international relationships. 
    \item It would help further the multi-robot system research at \ac{mdu}. 
    \item It would contribute to the \ac{ssl}-RoboCup community.
    \item If good performance is obtained (in RoboCup), then it would provide \ac{mdu} with significant institutional branding and recognition.
    \item It would offer fantastic learning opportunities for robotics and embedded system students.
\end{enumerate}
