\section{Limitations}
\label{section:limiations}

The following will not be delivered and thus marks the limitations of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No simulation will be delivered, the already developed grSim will be used.
    \item No global area network will be developed.
    \item Any type of kicks, manoeuvres or similar that was not listed in Goals section\:\ref{section:goal}.
    \item A physical testing environment.
    \item A physical test competition or game.
    \item Benchmarking of physical robots in action.
\end{itemize}
If these were not excluded, they would hamper early development to the point that the delivery of a complete product would be placed at risk.
