\section{Scope}
\label{section:scope}

The following is part of the scope of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Software
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A simulation interface which offers an API capable of sending robot commands to the simulation software grSim
        \item A hardware interface which offers an API for:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Activating wheel motors
            \item Activating kicker
            \item Sending sensor data
            \item Sending robot status information
        \end{itemize}
        \item An \ac{ssl} interface offering an API for receiving referee signals and commands from both a human referee and AutoReferee
        \item Robot control using \ac{ros2} Humble which handles:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Path planning
            \item Angling robot correctly to be able to shot ball towards commanded target
        \end{itemize}
        \item A centralised strategy planner using \ac{ai} which sends commands to the individual robots, informing them what they should do
        \item Peer to peer communication using Protobuf and \ac{ros2} Humble for communication between the individual robots and the centralised computes
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hardware
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One deployable \ac{ssl}-RoboCup compliant robot adhering to Swedish laws and standards
        \item Base design
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 3D-\acs{cad} design and printing of chassi
            \item 3D-\acs{cad} design and printing of wheels
        \end{itemize}
        \item Circuit design for:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Powertrain
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Motors
                \item \ac{esc}
                \item Battery
            \end{itemize}
            \item Kicker
            \item Dribbler
            \item Sensors
        \end{itemize}
        \item Modular design allowing for:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Swapping battery
            \item Swapping motor
            \item Swapping kicker
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
