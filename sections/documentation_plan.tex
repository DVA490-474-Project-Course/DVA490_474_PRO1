\section{Documentation plan}
\label{section:documentation_plan}

Good documentation is a critical tool to help project management since it allows for reviewing the work done and observing the progress. However it also serves other very important purposes like transparency, accountability and helps others understand, use and contribute to the project. To this end, the following documentation plan was established for this project.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{comment}
\helper{Plan for how the projectâ€™s documentation is to be managed. Example listed below.}

The purpose of a Documentation Plan is to provide a structured framework for creating, storing, reviewing, and disseminating project-related information. It ensures systematic recording and retention of all details, facilitating efficient communication, transparency, accountability, and continuity throughout the project. Comprehensive documentation is a critical tool in project management, aiding in tracking progress, making informed decisions, and providing references for future initiatives. Furthermore, it promotes knowledge sharing and learning during the project and beyond.

The following sections present a detailed example of a Documentation Plan. It outlines what needs to be documented, how and when to do so, who is responsible for various documentation tasks, where the documents will be stored, and the review and approval process for these documents. This example serves as a guide and should be tailored to fit your project's specific needs and circumstances.

\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%Define the types of documentation that will be required. This could include design documents, technical specifications, meeting minutes, code comments, testing reports, user manuals, troubleshooting guides, etc.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{How to Document}

All documentation is to be in British English and must follow scientific writing standards.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%Specify the format and structure of each document. For example, technical specifications might require diagrams and detailed descriptions, while meeting minutes may be more informal. Develop templates for consistency.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{When to Document}

It is paramount that documentation takes place the moment any work has been done or any changes have been made. For complete clarity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirements: documentation of any changes or additions to the requirements should be done instantly.
    \item Specifications: if any specifications are subject to change then the accompanying documentation must instantly be altered.
    \item Design: whenever there is an alteration of the design, the corresponding design files and documentation must be updated accordingly as soon as possible.
    \item Changes: all changes must be logged.
    \item Issues/Known bugs: when there is an update to an existing issue or bug, or a new one is found, then these must instantly be documented.
    \item Testing: any changes to existing tests, addition of new tests and test results must instantly be documented.
    \item User manual: the user manual must only be documented in time for the final release and whenever any post release updates are done.
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%Define when each document should be updated. For instance, design documents should be updated whenever a design decision is made, testing reports after every test run, and meeting minutes following each meeting.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Who is Responsible}

Team leads are responsible for overseeing their respective teams documentation as well as ensuring all the proper documentation is available and in proper order. Developers are responsible for producing proper documentation for everything they have done.
